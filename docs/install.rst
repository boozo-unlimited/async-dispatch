Installation
============

Async Dispatch uses the keywords ``async`` and ``await``, and thus requires `Python 3.5`_ or greater. 
This version of Python is distributed in the most recent release of `Ubuntu 16.04`_, and can be easily
installed on Mac OS X using `brew`_ .

.. _Ubuntu 16.04: http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/
.. _brew: http://brew.sh/
.. _Python 3.5: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/

The prefered way to install Async Dispatch for Python 3.5 is using `pip`::

   pip install async-dispatch
